create_gui_info_imagej
an imagej macro to mimic the function of create gui info. 
ImageJ because gui's are easy to work with, and it text process well with a subset of perl's functionality.
Also, with some clever wizzardy it could be used in windows, or even used remotely with some fun ssh communication via text dump. 

should be called with t/csh alias or bash function defined in radish_cshrc and radish_bashrc

getting these to work is somewhat ugly, as passing parameters to the imagej macro is not particularly easy.
See those sources for examples.
